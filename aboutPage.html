                <p>Enlisted in the Navy in 1985 and served for 10 years until 1995. During that time I was stationed on a nuclear submarine for 2 years, where I received a letter of commendation for excelling in my duties, preparing the vessels sick bay for deployment when the assigned corpsman was hospitalized and at the time I was an apprentice in training.
                    Was sent to Hospital Corpsman School, then to Pharmacy technician School. I was theen stationed at Portsmouth Naval Hospital then transferred to Bethesda Naval Hospital where my duties included Outpatient Pharmacy, Inpatient Pharmacy, Neonatal Preparations, Compounding and supply. During my time at Bethesda I received the National Defense Service Medal for service during the Persian Gulf War.
                I was also assigned during that time to the USNS Comfort Hospital Ship which deployed for Operation Sea Signal to assist in processing refugees in Haiti. </p>

                <p>After leaving the Navy, I entered the new home construcion field. Starting out as an apprentice painter then moving to exterior siding for 4 years. Worked with Classic Homes Builders and also some custom jobs. From scrapping to working walls and exterior trim.
                    In the everchanging weather in Colorado, we never let weather affect our productivity aside from the extreme.

                <img src="digital-retail.jpg" class="sectionimg">
                <p>Then it was on to Retail, I spent 15 years in retail. Starting as a cashier at 7-Eleven I moved up to Shift Manager then moved to Texas and got a position with Walmart as a Tire and Lube technician, I moved from there to Tire and Lube Express Manager, to Store Assistant Manager and finally to CoManager. In 13 years with Walmart I helped setup 2 new Supercenters, received a Regional Store of the Year Award and am very proud that I started from the bottom and achueved so much. From there I left Texas and moved to California
                    getting a position with Sears as their Home Improvement Manager and after that Operations Manager at Ross.

                <p>At the end of my time with Walmart and through my times with Sears and Ross, I was diagnosed with 3 different medical conditions that began limiting my abilities, I also saw that my future was not in Retail and my family suggested I look into coding. I have been
                    self studying since then and am attending Austin Coding Academy at present. With my health condition now under control I believe with my work history and proven ability to learn, grow and adapt that I would be an asset to any company.
